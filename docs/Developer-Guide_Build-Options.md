	- "sources" = delete `cache/sources` (all downloaded sources),
	- "extras" = delete additional packages for current release in `output/debs/extra`

    - set to "no" to build image with console interface only
- **EXTERNAL** (yes&#124;no):
    - set to "yes" to compile and install extra applications and firmware
- **BSPFREEZE** (no&#124;yes): freeze (from update) armbian packages when building images (u-boot, kernel, dtb)
- **INSTALL_HEADERS** (no&#124;yes): install kernel headers package
- **EXTERNAL_NEW** (no&#124;prebuilt&#124;compile):
	- set to "prebuilt" to install extra applications from repository
	- set to "compile" to compile extra applications in chroot
- **CREATE_PATCHES** (yes&#124;no):
	- set to "yes" will prompt you right before the compilation starts to make changes to the source code. Separate for u-boot and kernel. It will also create a patch out of this. If you want that this patch is included in the normal run, you need to copy it to appropriate directory
	- set to "no" compilation will run uninterrupted
- **BUILD_ALL** (yes&#124;no&#124;demo): cycle through all available board and kernel configurations and make images for all combinations
- **LIB_TAG** (master&#124;"branchname"):
	- set to "master" to compile from the master branch (default)
	- set to "branchname" to compile from any other branch available ("next" & "second" are deprecated and **not** recommended to use).
- **CARD_DEVICE** (/dev/sdx) set to the device of your SD card. The image will be burned and verified using Etcher for CLI.
- **CRYPTROOT_ENABLE** (yes&#124;no): set to enable LUKS encrypted rootfs. You must also provide unlock password CRYPTROOT_PASSPHRASE="MYSECRECTPASS" and optional CRYPTROOT_SSH_UNLOCK=yes CRYPTROOT_SSH_UNLOCK_PORT=2222 CRYPTROOT_PARAMETERS="custom cryptsetup options" Function **is under testing** and works only when building in native environment, Stretch and Bionic targets only, some kernels might lack dependencies. Building under the Docker not supported yet.
	

### Hidden options to minimize user input for build automation:
- **BOARD** (string): you can set name of board manually to skip dialog prompt
- **BRANCH** (default&#124;next&#124;dev): you can set kernel and u-boot branch manually to skip dialog prompt; some options may not be available for all devices
- **RELEASE** (stretch&#124;jessie&#124;bionic&#124;xenial): you can set OS release manually to skip dialog prompt; use this option with `KERNEL_ONLY=yes` to create board support package

### Hidden options for advanced users (default values are marked **bold**):
- **USE_CCACHE** (**yes**&#124;no): use a C compiler cache to speed up the build process
- **PRIVATE_CCACHE** (yes&#124;**no**) use `$DEST/ccache` as ccache home directory
- **PROGRESS_DISPLAY** (none&#124;**plain**&#124;dialog): way to display output of verbose processes - compilation, packaging, debootstrap
- **PROGRESS_LOG_TO_FILE** (yes&#124;**no**): duplicate output, affected by previous option, to log files `output/debug/*.log`
- **USE_MAINLINE_GOOGLE_MIRROR** (yes&#124;**no**): use `googlesource.com` mirror for downloading mainline kernel sources, may be faster than `git.kernel.org` depending on your location
- **USE_GITHUB_UBOOT_MIRROR** (yes&#124;**no**): use unofficial Github mirror for downloading mainline u-boot sources, may be faster than `git.denx.de` depending on your location
- **IGNORE_UPDATES** (yes&#124;**no**): skip downloading and updating sources
- **FORCE_USE_RAMDISK** (yes&#124;no): overrides autodetect for using tmpfs in new debootstrap and image creation process
- **FIXED_IMAGE_SIZE** (integer): create image file of this size (in megabytes) instead of minimal
- **COMPRESS_OUTPUTIMAGE** (yes&#124;**no**): create compressed archive with image file and GPG signature for redistribution
- **SEVENZIP** (yes&#124;**no**): create .7z archive with extreme compression ratio instead of .zip
- **BUILD_KSRC** (**yes**&#124;no): create kernel source packages 
- **ROOTFS_TYPE** (**ext4**&#124;f2fs&#124;btrfs&#124;nfs&#124;fel): create image with different root filesystems instead of default ext4. Requires setting `FIXED_IMAGE_SIZE` to something smaller than the size of your SD card for F2FS
- **FORCE_CHECKOUT** (yes&#124;no): set to "no" to skip forced sources checkout and patching
- **FORCE_BOOTSCRIPT_UPDATE** (yes&#124;no): set to "yes" to force bootscript to get updated during bsp package upgrade
- **NAMESERVER** (ipv4 address): the DNS resolver used inside the build chroot. Does not affect the final image. Default: 1.0.0.1
- **DOWNLOAD_MIRROR** select download mirror for `toolchain` and `debian/ubuntu packages`.
	- set to `china` to use `mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn`, it will be very fast for mainland china users thanks to tsinghua university.
	- leave it unset to use official source.
- **MAINLINE_MIRROR** select mainline mirror of `linux-stable.git`
	- set to `google` to use mirror provided by Google, the same as `USE_MAINLINE_GOOGLE_MIRROR=yes`.
	- set to `tuna` to use mirror provided by tsinghua university.
	- leave it unset to use offical `git.kernel.org`.
